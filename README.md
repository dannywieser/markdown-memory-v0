`markdown-memory` is not _yet another_ note taking application.

It is an application that acknowledges that the act of _review_ and _reflection_ on your notes is different than the act of note taking.

It is an application that leverages the power of modern web browsers to augment and enhance your ability to perform those activities.

`markdown-memory` allows you to take notes _however you like_ while still layering on rich capabilities to query and _introspect_ those notes.

It does so in a secure, self-hosted fashion - never questioning that you own your notes; your writing.

_this app is in progress - stay tuned for updates!_
