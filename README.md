# markdown-memory

`markdown-memory` is not _yet another_ note taking application.

It is an application that acknowledges that the act of _review_ and _reflection_ on your notes is different than the act of note taking.

## next

- still bug with recent entry stats!
- cleanup code for icon handling
- tag stats: total tags, Most active tags
- tags page, see all notes for a given tag
- hover over squares on frequency map with tooltip

## Milestone 1

App that does everything I need it to, and is deployed to the cloud.
Security (mainly encryption) can come later.
Extractor as a more user friendly standalone app that runs locally
I guess I will need basic auth here - the API calls to retrieve the data need to be behind auth

## Milestone 2

- Text Extractor + Demo
- Docs about how it works and the architecture
- At this point it can be a "portfolio" project I could share when applying for jobs

## Milestone 3

- New User support
- Encryption during transfer and at rest

## Future Feature Ideas

- Pinned Headers
